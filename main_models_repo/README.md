# Main Models Repository

This project contains analysis and modeling scripts related to emotion and sentiment classification.

## Structure

- `supervised_models.py`: Traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- `transformer_models.py`: Deep learning models using transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)
- `figures/`: Auto-generated plots and visualizations
- `results/`: Evaluation results (metrics, thresholds)

## How to Use

Run each script individually based on the task:

```bash
python supervised_models.py
python transformer_models.py
```

Each script saves outputs in the corresponding folder.
